# House_Price_Prediction
This project predicts house prices using a machine learning approach. The project includes the following steps:

Data Import and Preprocessing: The dataset is imported using Pandas, and missing data handling and data cleaning are performed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to explore the relationships between various features and the target variable (house price).
Feature Engineering: Additional features are created, and feature transformations are applied to improve the predictive performance.
Modeling: Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, or other suitable models are trained on the data to predict house prices.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and tuning is performed to optimize its accuracy.
