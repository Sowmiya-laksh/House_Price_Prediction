> # House Price Prediction
### Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains 79 features describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts house prices based on these features.

### Problem Statement
#### Task 1:
Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given dataset.
#### Task 2:
a) Create a robust machine learning algorithm to predict house prices.\
b) Analyze the relationship between house features and price variations.
#### Task 3:
Provide suggestions for customers to buy a house according to area, price, and other requirements.
### Dataset Description
The dataset includes 79 explanatory variables describing the physical and financial features of houses, ranging from the building class and lot size to roof material and the presence of a pool. The target > > > 
variable is SalePrice, representing the sale price of a house.

### Attributes
### Key attributes include:

**MSSubClass** : The building class\
**LotArea** : Lot size in square feet\
**Neighborhood** : Physical locations within Ames city limits\
**YearBuilt** : Year of construction\
**OverallQual** : Overall material and finish quality\
**GrLivArea** : Above ground living area square feet\
**SalePrice** : Target variable representing house sale price in dollars\
(A full list of attributes is available in the dataset)

### Solution Approach
**Data Analysis and Preprocessing** : Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.\
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** : Understanding relationships between features and house prices using visualizations.\
**Modeling** : Training various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict house prices.\
**Model Evaluation** : Comparing model performance and selecting the best one based on accuracy and other metrics.
### Challenges Faced
Handling missing values and outliers in the dataset.\
Feature selection and engineering for improved model performance.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the machine learning models.
### Practice Skills
Creative feature engineering
Regression techniques like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
### Conclusion
This project built a machine learning model to predict house prices. After data preprocessing, EDA, and model testing, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting emerged as top performers. Key factors like overall quality and living area had a strong impact on prices. Future work can involve further tuning for improved accuracy.
